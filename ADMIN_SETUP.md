## 🚀 Admin User Creation

### Step 1: Set Required Secrets

Before creating your first admin user, configure these Encore secrets:

```bash
# Auth0 Configuration (existing)
encore secret set Auth0Domain <your-tenant>.auth0.com
encore secret set Auth0Audience <your-api-identifier>

# NEW: Security Secrets (required)
encore secret set Auth0WebhookSecret <webhook-secret-from-auth0>
encore secret set AdminInitSecret <choose-strong-random-secret>
```

### Step 2: Create Initial Admin User

Use this endpoint to create your first admin user:

**Endpoint**: `POST /admin/create-initial`

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "email": "admin@yourcompany.com",
  "name": "System Administrator", 
  "department": "IT",
  "auth0Sub": "auth0|user-id-from-auth0",
  "initSecret": "your-admin-init-secret"
}
```

**Example using curl**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.com/admin/create-initial \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@yourcompany.com",
    "name": "System Administrator",
    "department": "IT", 
    "auth0Sub": "auth0|1234567890",
    "initSecret": "your-admin-init-secret"
  }'
```

### Step 3: Get Auth0 User ID

To find the `auth0Sub` for your admin user:

1. Go to Auth0 Dashboard > User Management > Users
2. Find your admin user
3. Copy the User ID (format: `auth0|1234567890`)

### Step 4: Verify Admin Creation

After creating the admin user, verify the setup:

**Health Check**: `GET /admin/health` (requires authentication)
**System Stats**: `GET /admin/stats` (requires authentication)

## 🔧 Additional Admin Operations

### Create Additional Admin Users

Once you have an initial admin, you can create more:

**Endpoint**: `POST /admin/create` (requires HR role)

```json
{
  "email": "another-admin@yourcompany.com",
  "name": "HR Administrator",
  "department": "Human Resources",
  "auth0Sub": "auth0|another-user-id"
}
```

### Update User Roles

Promote users to manager or HR roles:

**Endpoint**: `PUT /admin/update-role` (requires HR role)

```json
{
  "employeeId": 123,
  "newRole": "hr"  // "employee", "manager", or "hr"
}
```

## 📋 Production Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Pre-Deployment (Completed)
- [x] All 3 critical security blockers resolved
- [x] Security headers implemented
- [x] Error sanitization for production
- [x] Performance caching implemented
- [x] Build optimization completed

### 🎯 Post-Deployment Actions

1. **Configure Auth0 Webhook**:
   - In Auth0 Dashboard > Monitoring > Log Streams
   - Add webhook URL: `https://your-app.com/auth0/webhook`
   - Set webhook secret in Auth0
   - Test webhook signature verification

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Monitor Security Metrics**:
   - Authentication success/failure rates
   - Cache hit rates (target: >80%)
   - Response times (target: <2s 95th percentile)
   - Error rates (target: <1%)

4. **Enable Production Security Headers**:
   Configure your load balancer/CDN with:
   ```
   Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
   ```

## 🚨 Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Authentication Metrics**:
   - Failed login attempts >10/hour
   - Token validation failures
   - Unusual geographic access patterns

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Cache hit rate (should be >80%)
   - Database response times
   - JWKS endpoint availability

3. **Security Events**:
   - Invalid webhook signatures
   - Replay attack attempts
   - Privilege escalation attempts

### Incident Response

**If security incident detected**:
1. Check system health: `GET /admin/health`
2. Review recent logs for anomalies
3. Verify Auth0 webhook signatures
4. Monitor cache performance metrics

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Invalid initialization secret"
**Solution**: Verify `AdminInitSecret` matches exactly

**Issue**: "Admin user already exists"
**Solution**: Use `/admin/create` endpoint for additional admins

**Issue**: "Webhook signature verification failed"
**Solution**: Check `Auth0WebhookSecret` matches Auth0 configuration

### Health Check Commands

```bash
# System health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://your-app.com/admin/health

# Cache statistics (check logs)
# Look for "[Cache Metrics]" entries showing hit rates

# Auth0 integration test
# Verify successful login and user synchronization
```
