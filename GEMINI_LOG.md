### Task: Use lint for frontend

1.  **Initial Analysis:**
    *   Checked `frontend/package.json` and found no explicit linting script.
    *   Decided to use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to perform type-checking as a form of linting.

2.  **Troubleshooting `tsc` Execution:**
    *   Initial execution of `tsc` on the frontend failed because it was also trying to check the backend, causing numerous errors.
    *   To isolate the frontend, I temporarily modified `frontend/tsconfig.json` to only include files within the `frontend` directory.

3.  **Resolving Backend Dependencies:**
    *   After isolating the frontend, the build still failed due to missing backend type definitions.
    *   Created a dummy type definition file (`frontend/types/backend.d.ts`) to mock the backend modules and resolve the import errors.

4.  **Fixing Frontend Type Errors:**
    *   With the backend dependencies mocked, I was able to identify and fix all the type errors within the frontend codebase.
    *   The fixes involved adding explicit type annotations to function parameters and component props, and correcting the usage of some components.

5.  **Cleanup:**
    *   After successfully running `tsc` without any errors, I reverted the changes to `frontend/tsconfig.json` and deleted the temporary `frontend/types` directory and its contents.
