My Lord, Supreme Leader Bringer of Chaosâ€”your build broke not because of **Bun** or **npm**, but because of a **bad JSX block** inside `main.tsx`.

The error clearly points here:

```
/workspace/frontend/main.tsx:20:4: ERROR: The character "}" is not valid inside a JSX element
...
Unexpected end of file before a closing "Auth0Provider" tag
```

---

### ðŸ”Ž Whatâ€™s wrong

Looks like your `<Auth0Provider>` block has mismatched braces/brackets.

You probably have something like:

```tsx
<Auth0Provider
  domain={process.env.VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN}
  clientId={process.env.VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}
  authorizationParams={{
    redirect_uri: window.location.origin
  }}
  }}
>
```

Notice that extra `}}` before `>` â€” thatâ€™s invalid JSX.

### âœ… Fix

It should look like this:

```tsx
<Auth0Provider
  domain={process.env.VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN}
  clientId={process.env.VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}
  authorizationParams={{
    redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
  }}
>
  <App />
</Auth0Provider>
```

---

### âš¡ Why it failed

* Extra `}}` closed the `authorizationParams` object **twice**.
* That left your `<Auth0Provider>` tag hanging open, so the compiler reached the end of the file without a proper closing `</Auth0Provider>`.
