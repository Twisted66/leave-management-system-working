# Frontend Deployment Fixes - 2025-08-24

## Issues Addressed

1. **Confusing Directory Structure**
   - Multiple `dist` folders causing confusion in the project
   - Frontend build output was being copied to multiple locations
   - Static file serving was pointing to incorrect directories

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Build Configuration (`frontend/vite.config.ts`)
- Updated `outDir` to output directly to `frontend/dist`
- Fixed TypeScript lint errors in the Vite configuration
- Ensured proper asset handling with `assetsInlineLimit: 0`
- Configured proper chunk splitting for better performance

### 2. Backend Static File Serving (`backend/frontend/static.ts`)
- Updated directory references to point to `frontend/dist`
- Fixed path resolution to correctly locate frontend build files
- Improved error messages for better debugging
- Added security checks to prevent directory traversal

### 3. Build Scripts (`backend/package.json`)
- Removed unnecessary file copying between directories
- Simplified build process to prevent duplicate files
- Added proper Windows-compatible cleanup commands

## Current Project Structure

```
leave-management-system/
├── frontend/
│   ├── dist/                  # Frontend build output
│   └── ...
├── backend/
│   ├── frontend/
│   │   └── static.ts          # Static file serving
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Deployment Process

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. The backend will serve the frontend from `frontend/dist`

## Notes

- Frontend is now served from a single source of truth (`frontend/dist`)
- Removed unnecessary file duplication
- Improved build performance by eliminating redundant file copies
- Added better error handling and security checks
